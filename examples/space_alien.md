Greetings, Human! Glad you've finally woken up! You banged your head quite badly there and we were worried that your central processing unit was severely damaged, but it seems that you're fine enough to open your eyes! Wonderful. How do you feel?

Oh! Right, sorry. "brain" you call it, I think. Funny word. Sounds almost fake, if you ask me.
